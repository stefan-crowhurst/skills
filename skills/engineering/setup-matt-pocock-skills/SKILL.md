# Setup Matt Pocock's Skills

Scaffold the per-repo configuration that the engineering skills assume:

- **Issue tracker**: local markdown files under `.scratch/`
- **Triage status strings**: the values used for the five canonical triage roles
- **Domain docs**: where `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs live, and the consumer rules for reading them

This is a prompt-driven skill, not a deterministic script. Explore, present what you found, confirm with the user, then write.

## Process

### 1. Explore

Look at the current repo to understand its starting state. Read whatever exists; don't assume:

- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root: does either exist? Is there already an `## Agent skills` section in either?
- `CONTEXT.md` and `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the repo root
- `docs/adr/` and any `src/*/docs/adr/` directories
- `docs/agents/`: does this skill's prior output already exist?
- `.scratch/`: a sign that a local-markdown issue tracker convention is already in use
- Is the `triage` skill installed? (a `triage` skill folder alongside this one, or `triage` in your available skills.) This decides whether Section B runs at all.
- Monorepo signals: a `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, a `workspaces` field in `package.json`, or a populated `packages/*` with its own `src/`. These are present only in a genuinely large multi-package repo; their absence means single-context, which is almost every repo.

### 2. Present findings and ask

Summarise what's present and what's missing. Then take the sections in order. One section, one answer, then the next.

Lead each section with the recommended answer so the user can accept it in a word. Give a one-line explainer only when the choice genuinely branches; skip the section entirely when exploration already settled it (Section B when `triage` isn't installed, Section C when there's no monorepo).

**Section A: Local issue tracker.**

> Explainer: The issue tracker is where issues live for this repo. These skills use the local markdown convention under `.scratch/`, so there is no host or CLI to select.

There is no tracker choice to make. Confirm that issues and specs should be stored as local markdown under `.scratch/`, then record that convention in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

**Section B: Triage status vocabulary.** Skip this section entirely if the `triage` skill isn't installed (exploration told you), since an uninstalled skill needs no status mapping.

If it is installed, ask exactly one question:

> Do you want to keep the default triage status strings? (recommended: **yes**)

The defaults are the five canonical status strings: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. On **yes**, write them as-is. Only if the user says no, collect the replacement strings they want to use in local issue files.

**Section C: Domain docs.** Default to **single-context** (one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root). This fits almost every repo; write it without asking.

Offer **multi-context** (a root `CONTEXT-MAP.md` pointing to per-context `CONTEXT.md` files) only when exploration found monorepo signals. Then confirm which layout they want.

### 3. Confirm and edit

Show the user a draft of:

- The `## Agent skills` block to add to whichever of `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` is being edited (see step 4 for selection rules)
- The contents of `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, `docs/agents/domain.md`, and `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` (the last only when `triage` is installed)

Let them edit before writing.

### 4. Write

**Pick the file to edit:**

- If `CLAUDE.md` exists, edit it.
- Else if `AGENTS.md` exists, edit it.
- If neither exists, ask the user which one to create; don't pick for them.

Never create `AGENTS.md` when `CLAUDE.md` already exists (or vice versa); always edit the one that's already there.

If an `## Agent skills` block already exists in the chosen file, update its contents in-place rather than appending a duplicate. Don't overwrite user edits to the surrounding sections.

The block:

```markdown
## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

[one-line summary of where issues are tracked]. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage status strings

[one-line summary of the status vocabulary]. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

[one-line summary of layout: "single-context" or "multi-context"]. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
```

Include the `### Triage status strings` sub-block, and write `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`, only when `triage` is installed and Section B ran. When it isn't, both are omitted.

Then write the docs files using the seed templates in this skill folder as a starting point:

- [issue-tracker-local.md](./issue-tracker-local.md): local-markdown issue tracker
- [triage-labels.md](./triage-labels.md): status mapping (only if `triage` is installed)
- [domain.md](./domain.md): domain doc consumer rules + layout

Write `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` from the local-markdown seed.

### 5. Done

Tell the user the setup is complete and which engineering skills will now read from these files. Mention they can edit `docs/agents/*.md` directly later; re-running this skill is only necessary to restart from scratch.
